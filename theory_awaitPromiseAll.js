/*
Async Await
Await Promise.all()

Another way to take advantage of concurrency when we have multiple promises
which can be executed simultaneously is to await a Promise.all().

We can pass an array of promises as the argument to Promise.all(), and it will
return a single promise. This promise will resolve when all of the promises in
the argument array have resolved. This promise’s resolve value will be an array
containing the resolved values of each promise from the argument array.
*/

async function asyncPromAll() {
  const resultArray = await Promise.all([asyncTask1(), asyncTask2(),
  asyncTask3(), asyncTask4()]);
  for (let i = 0; i < resultArray.length; i++) {
    console.log(resultArray[i]);
  }
}

/*
In our above example, we await the resolution of a Promise.all().
This Promise.all() was invoked with an argument array containing four promises
(returned from required-in functions). Next, we loop through our resultArray,
and log each item to the console. The first element in resultArray is the
resolved value of the asyncTask1() promise, the second is the value of the
asyncTask2() promise, and so on.

Promise.all() allows us to take advantage of asynchronicity— each of the four
asynchronous tasks can process concurrently. Promise.all() also has the benefit
of failing fast, meaning it won’t wait for the rest of the asynchronous actions
to complete once any one has rejected. As soon as the first promise in the array
rejects, the promise returned from Promise.all() will reject with that reason.
As it was when working with native promises, Promise.all() is a good choice if
multiple asynchronous tasks are all required, but none must wait for any other
before executing.
Instructions
1.

In this exercise, we require in the same four functions as in the last exercise:
cookBeans(), steamBroccoli(), cookRice(), and bakeChicken().

These functions each return a promise which will resolve to a string
representing a part of a meal. You can check them out in the library.js file.
Press “Check Work” to move on to the next step.
2.

You’re going to create a very similar function to the serveDinner() function you
created in the last exercise. This time, you’ll use Promise.all()!

Create an async function serveDinnerAgain(). Inside your function, declare a
variable foodArray and assign it the resolved value of the promise returned from
Promise.all().

Remember that Promise.all() takes in an array of promises. Pass in an array
containing the steamBroccoli(), cookRice(), bakeChicken(), and cookBeans()
functions in that order.

Don’t forget to await Promise.all()! Your code may follow a similar pattern to
this:
*/

async function myFunction() {
  let myArray = await Promise.all([returnsPromise1(), returnsPromise2(), returnsPromise3()]);
}

/*
3.

Next console.log() a string in the following format: Dinner is served. We’re
having [first item in foodArray ], [second item in foodArray ], [third item in
  foodArray], and [fourth item in foodArray ]. eg. ‘Dinner is served. We’re
  having broccoli, rice, chicken, and beans.’

There are a few different ways you can accomplish the desired functionality.
Check out the hint if you want some guidance.

Now that you have an array holding each of the promises’ resolved values, you
can use string interpolation or concatenation to log the required string.

One option is to save variable for each value:
*/

let vegetable = foodArray[0];
let starch = foodArray[1];
let protein = foodArray[2];
let side = foodArray[3];

console.log(`Dinner is served. We're having ${vegetable}, ${starch}, ${protein}, and ${side}.`);

/*
If you’re confident in your logic but this step isn’t passing, make sure to
double check your spelling and punctuation.
4.

Ok great! Now let’s see your function in action. Beneath your function
declaration, invoke serveDinnerAgain().
5.

In the terminal type node app.js and press enter to run the code.
